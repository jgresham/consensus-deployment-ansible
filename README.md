# Testnet ansible files + Config

This repository is a minimal set of playbooks and inventories required to set up the merge devnets consisting of execution and 
consensus nodes. 

## General information
- General folder structure: All testnet relevant configs are under the testnet names. Generic config variables are set under
`<name>-testnet/inventory/group_vars/all.yaml`. Client specific variables are set under e.g `<name>-testnet/inventory/group_vars/eth2client_xxxxxx.yaml`.
The client specific variables also contains the commands used to start the docker image with. 
- All the config files, `genesis.ssz` and other variables needed for the testnet are placed under `<name>-testnet/custom_config_data`.

## Instructions to join testnet  
1. Clone this repository  
2. Ensure `docker` and `docker-compose` is installed: `docker-compose --version` and `docker --version`
3. Change directories with `cd consensus-deployment-ansible/scripts/quick-run/<testnet-type>`  
4. Create the required directories for persistent data with `mkdir -p execution_data beacon_data`  
5. Find your IP address(public IP) and add it to the `<testnet-name>.vars` file file located in `consensus-deployment-ansible/scripts/quick-run/`, this is just to ensure easy peering  
5.1 `curl ifconfig.me` or visit https://whatismyipaddress.com  
5.2 Replace IP in config file with your own IP address: https://i.imgur.com/xnNqN6h.png  
6. Run your chosen execution engine, e.g: `docker-compose --env-file <testnet-name>.vars -f docker-compose.geth.yml up -d`  
7. Run your chosen consensus engine, e.g: `docker-compose --env-file <testnet-name>.vars -f docker-compose.lighthouse.yml up -d`  
8. Check your logs to confirm that they are up and syncing, e.g `docker logs lighthouse_beacon -f --tail=20`  
9. To stop the clients, run `docker-compose -f <insert file name you used earlier here> down`

## Instructions for running ansible playbooks (Only works if you have access)
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure `ansible` is installed
3. Make changes in the required variable, e.g: Change the `pithos-testnet/inventory/group_vars/eth1client_ethereumjs.yaml`
with the new docker image or the `eth1_start_args` for commands to run the container with
4. The `update_execution_beacon_and_validator.yml` will stop the execution, beacon and validator containers and restart them
with the new configurations specified as variables. Please use the `limit=eth1/2_xxxx` flag to limit the playbook execution to just update
the nodes you have access to (otherwise it won't change the config on the others, but will show a lot of errors).
Run this playbook with: `ansible-playbook -i pithos-testnet/inventory/inventory.ini playbooks/update_execution_beacon_and_validator.yml --limit=eth1client_ethereumjs`
5. If you just want to update an execution node without touching the other docker containers use the `tasks`, e.g to restart execution node with the new parameters use, 
```bash
ansible-playbook -i pithos-testnet/inventory/inventory.ini playbooks/tasks/stop_execution_node.yml --limit=eth1client_ethereumjs
ansible-playbook -i pithos-testnet/inventory/inventory.ini playbooks/tasks/start_execution_node.yml --limit=eth1client_ethereumjs
```
